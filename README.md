# 🎮 Pac-Man in Assembly (8086 / Irvine32)

A fully functional **Pac-Man game built completely in Assembly Language** using the **Irvine32 library**.  
This project includes multiple levels, music, ghost behavior, collision detection, scoring, and a persistent high-score system — all written from scratch in low-level x86 assembly.

> One of the most challenging and complete Assembly projects — manually handling movement, drawing, sound, and logic at the CPU instruction level.
